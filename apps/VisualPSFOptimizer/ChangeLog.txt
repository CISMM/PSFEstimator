2010-05-10  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.cxx: Moved initialization of settings cache in the
   PSF property table model immediately after the image file is opened. Fixed
   up on_actionLoadSession_triggered() so that all settings are read and the
   GUI gets updated.

2010-05-10  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.cxx: Moved comparison metric display to under the Apply
   button from the image information window. Shrunk some widget spacings to show
   more controls in a smaller space.

2010-05-07  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.cxx: Changed background color to dark gray instead of
   bright blue.

2010-04-13  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * QPointSpreadFunctionPropertyTableModel.cxx: Now sets the bead-spread
   function center and displays it in the GUI.
   
   * VisualPSFOptimizer.cxx: Added code to ensure that the parameters found
   by the optimization routine are displayed in the GUI.

2010-04-13  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.cxx: Set background color to near Carolina blue to make
   it easier to see boundaries of the PSF.

2010-04-13  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.cxx: Added call to Sully() after the optimize button
   has been pressed.

2010-03-31  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.h,.cxx,.ui: Added widget that displays the image 
   comparison metric value. The value is updated whenever the Apply button
   is clicked. This provides a good objective way to see what parameters give
   a better fit.

2010-03-29  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.cxx: Fixed problem with PSF settings loaded from a
   session file not being shown.

2010-03-28  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * QPointSpreadFunctionPropertyTableModel.cxx: Now shows table entries for
   custom z slice positions only if the UseCustomZCoordinates is set to true.
   
   * VisualPSFOptimizer.h,.cxx,.ui: Added check box to toggle UseCustomZCoordinates.
   Added button to populate the custom z coordinates with equal spacing equivalent
   to the z spacing of the ITK image data object.

2010-03-28  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * QPointSpreadFunctionPropertyTableModel.cxx: Added z slice coordinates
   to the model.

2010-03-28  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Add source files for QPointSpreadFunctionPropertyTableModel.
   
   * QPointSpreadFunctionPropertyTableModel.,.cxx: Table model for PSF
   properties. Using this class cleans up the main application class a bunch.
   
   * VisualPSFOptimizer.h,.cxx: Added QPointSpreadFunctionPropertyTableModel
   and a slot for its dataChanged signal. Changed property table editor so that
   the current value of the property populates the editor (before, the value
   would be cleared). Added enabling/disabling certain interface buttons when
   appropriate to avoid user accidentally crashing the program.
   
   * VisualPSFOptimizer.ui: Removed a leftover "Apply" button that no longer
   fit. 

2010-03-26  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.cxx: Now turns GUI widgets on/off where appropriate to
   avoid letting user do something that will crash the program.
   
   * VisualPSFOptimizer.ui: Disabled GUI widgets that should be disabled at
   program startup.

2010-03-26  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.cxx: Fixed up some references to GUI member variables
   which used to be inherited from the Ui_MainWindow class.

2010-03-26  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.h,.cxx: GUI class is now a member variable instead of
   parent class. This should speed up compile times whenever this class is
   changed.

2009-10-07  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Added NewImageDialog.ui interface file.

   * NewImageDialog.ui: Dialog box to specify size of new image.

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.h,.cxx: Added new image dialog and method to
   create a new PSF image file. Hooked up the dialog to a "New" file menu
   item. Factored out some common code into new method SetupRenderer().

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.ui: Added "New Image" item to file menu.

2009-10-06  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.cxx: When handling Apply button clicks, now updates 
   only the PSF if the PSF is set to be displayed or the BSF if it is set
   to be displayed.

2009-09-22  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.cxx: Fixed off-by-one error when setting estimated
   PSF center.

2009-09-14  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.ui: Changed Ctrl-O keyboard shortcut to open
   session file instead of an image file.

2009-09-14  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.h,.cxx: Added method on_actionSaveBSFImage_triggered()
   to save the generated bead-spread function.
   
   * VisualPSFOptimizer.ui: Added item in File menu to save the bead-spread
   function.

2009-09-14  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.cxx: Added initialization of m_DisplayedImage member
   variable.

2009-09-14  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Fixed path to icon file.

2009-09-09  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.cxx: Renamed "PSF center Z" to "Bead center Z".

2009-09-08  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.h,.ui: Renambed "Settings" to "Session". 
   
   * VisualPSFOptimizer.cxx: Added bead radius parameter. Changed "PSF Center"
   parameters to "Bead Center". Session files contain the path to the loaded
   PSF image now, which is loaded when the session file is loaded. Started tying
   bead-spread function class into GUI (intermediate check-in).

2009-07-26  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.h,.cxx,.ui: Added radio button for displaying a 
   bead-spread function (BSF). Moved contrast controls closer to radio button to
   be more conveniently accessible. Added loading/saving of program settings 
   (basically, the Gibson-Lanni parameters). Added CCD border size to list of
   PSF parameters. Changed slider handlers to handle valueChanged events instead
   of sliderMoved events because sliderMoved events aren't triggered when you 
   click on a slider position (rather than moving the slider to that position)
   but valueChanged events are.

2009-07-22  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.h,.cxx,.ui: Added button and handler for getting an
   initial estimate of the center of the measured PSF.

2009-07-21  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.h,.cxx: Moved all the mutable image settings into the
   PSF parameters table. Added checkboxes in the PSF parameters table to enable
   selection of which parameters to optimize. Added dirty bit and Sully() method
   to keep track of when the parameter settings have been changed.

2009-07-20  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.h,.cxx: Removed unneeded handler for origin recentering
   button, which is now gone. On application of user settings, the origin is
   now updated so that (0,0,0) is in the center of the image volume. Updated
   GUI to show PSF center now instead of the image origin.
   
   * VisualPSFOptimizer.ui: Removed origin recentering button.

2009-07-20  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.cxx: Added call to RefreshUI() after optimization to
   display optimal parameters.

2009-07-20  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.cxx: Connected optimize button to the optimizer's
   Optimize() method.

2009-07-17  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Added ITKNumerics library dependency.
   
   * VisualPSFOptimizer.h,.cxx: Added handlers for radio buttons controlling
   which image (measured or calculated) is displayed. Added handler for new
   "make it better" button in the GUI. Refactored some code to better deal with
   switching which image is displayed.
   
   * VisualPSFOptimizer.ui: Added radio buttons for picking which image is
   displayed (easier to flip back and forth with these than a pop-up menu).
   Added "make it better" button.

2009-07-14  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.h,.cxx: Added button to recenter the origin of an image
   after the voxel spacings have been changed. Removed handler for updates to
   image settings and now read settings only when the Apply button is clicked.
   
   * VisualPSFOptimizer.ui: Added Recenter PSF Origin button.

2009-07-09  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.ui: Added buttons for setting canonical camera views
   aligned with the x, y, and z axes.
   
   * VisualPSFOptimizer.h,.cxx: Updated to work with changes to Visualization
   class. Made PSF dimension entries in image information table editable and
   connected them to the Gibson-Lanni PSF generator class. Added handlers for
   canonical camera view buttons. 

2009-07-08  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.cxx: Changed method calls to match method renaming.

2009-07-02  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * Initial check-in.
