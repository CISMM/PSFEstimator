2009-09-14  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.ui: Changed Ctrl-O keyboard shortcut to open
   session file instead of an image file.

2009-09-14  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.h,.cxx: Added method on_actionSaveBSFImage_triggered()
   to save the generated bead-spread function.
   
   * VisualPSFOptimizer.ui: Added item in File menu to save the bead-spread
   function.

2009-09-14  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.cxx: Added initialization of m_DisplayedImage member
   variable.

2009-09-14  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Fixed path to icon file.

2009-09-09  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.cxx: Renamed "PSF center Z" to "Bead center Z".

2009-09-08  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.h,.ui: Renambed "Settings" to "Session". 
   
   * VisualPSFOptimizer.cxx: Added bead radius parameter. Changed "PSF Center"
   parameters to "Bead Center". Session files contain the path to the loaded
   PSF image now, which is loaded when the session file is loaded. Started tying
   bead-spread function class into GUI (intermediate check-in).

2009-07-26  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.h,.cxx,.ui: Added radio button for displaying a 
   bead-spread function (BSF). Moved contrast controls closer to radio button to
   be more conveniently accessible. Added loading/saving of program settings 
   (basically, the Gibson-Lanni parameters). Added CCD border size to list of
   PSF parameters. Changed slider handlers to handle valueChanged events instead
   of sliderMoved events because sliderMoved events aren't triggered when you 
   click on a slider position (rather than moving the slider to that position)
   but valueChanged events are.

2009-07-22  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.h,.cxx,.ui: Added button and handler for getting an
   initial estimate of the center of the measured PSF.

2009-07-21  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.h,.cxx: Moved all the mutable image settings into the
   PSF parameters table. Added checkboxes in the PSF parameters table to enable
   selection of which parameters to optimize. Added dirty bit and Sully() method
   to keep track of when the parameter settings have been changed.

2009-07-20  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.h,.cxx: Removed unneeded handler for origin recentering
   button, which is now gone. On application of user settings, the origin is
   now updated so that (0,0,0) is in the center of the image volume. Updated
   GUI to show PSF center now instead of the image origin.
   
   * VisualPSFOptimizer.ui: Removed origin recentering button.

2009-07-20  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.cxx: Added call to RefreshUI() after optimization to
   display optimal parameters.

2009-07-20  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.cxx: Connected optimize button to the optimizer's
   Optimize() method.

2009-07-17  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Added ITKNumerics library dependency.
   
   * VisualPSFOptimizer.h,.cxx: Added handlers for radio buttons controlling
   which image (measured or calculated) is displayed. Added handler for new
   "make it better" button in the GUI. Refactored some code to better deal with
   switching which image is displayed.
   
   * VisualPSFOptimizer.ui: Added radio buttons for picking which image is
   displayed (easier to flip back and forth with these than a pop-up menu).
   Added "make it better" button.

2009-07-14  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.h,.cxx: Added button to recenter the origin of an image
   after the voxel spacings have been changed. Removed handler for updates to
   image settings and now read settings only when the Apply button is clicked.
   
   * VisualPSFOptimizer.ui: Added Recenter PSF Origin button.

2009-07-09  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.ui: Added buttons for setting canonical camera views
   aligned with the x, y, and z axes.
   
   * VisualPSFOptimizer.h,.cxx: Updated to work with changes to Visualization
   class. Made PSF dimension entries in image information table editable and
   connected them to the Gibson-Lanni PSF generator class. Added handlers for
   canonical camera view buttons. 

2009-07-08  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * VisualPSFOptimizer.cxx: Changed method calls to match method renaming.

2009-07-02  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * Initial check-in.
