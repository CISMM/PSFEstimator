   * CMakeLists.txt: Added itkScanImageFilter to source list.

   * itk/itkGibsonLanniPSFImageSource.h,.cxx: Renamed ComputePixelValue() to
   ComputeSampleValue() (that's what it does) and added method
   ComputeIntegratedPixelValue() that performs the integration over a CCD
   element.

   * itk/itkScanImageFilter.h,.cxx: New class that performs a scan of all rows
   along a specified direction. The scan operator is a template parameter to 
   this class, so you can compute prefix sums, prefix min/max, etc. by 
   specifying a different operator (such operators are already defined in ITK).
   I'm going to use this for computing prefix sums of a super-sampled PSF image
   for use in efficient convolution of the PSF with volume-labeled geometry.

2009-07-23  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * itk/itkGibsonLanniPSFImageSource.h,.cxx: Added CCD border member variables
   as well as its setters and getters.

2009-07-21  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * itk/itkGibsonLanniPSFImageSource.cxx: Moved translation of PSF center point
   to immediately after voxel coordinate collection. z translation was not
   getting set.

2009-07-20  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * itk/itkGibsonLanniPSFImageSource.h,.cxx: Added point source center and
   accessors for it, as well as modified the PSF computation to take this into
   account. The parameter list now includes this instead of the image origin.
   
   * itk/itkImageToParameterizedImageSourceMetric.cxx: Added request of full
   image region to the moving image source. I'm still in shock that downstream
   filters in the pipeline can modify this in a way that sticks for filters
   branching off down another pipeline.

2009-07-20  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * itk/itkGibsonLanniPSFImageSource.h: Added some helpful comments.
   
   * itk/itkImageToParameterizedImageSourceMetric.cxx: Now GetValue() method
   sets only the active parameters (was setting all parameters, which was
   a major programming error). Method SetFixedImageRegion passes on region to
   the delegate ImageToImageMetric and removed the m_FixedImageRegion member
   variable.

2009-07-20  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * itk/itkImageToParameterizedImageSourceMetric.h,.cxx: Added parameter mask to
   enable optimization of only certain parameters in the ParameterizedImageSource.

2009-07-17  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * itkGibsonLanniPSFImageSource.h,.cxx: Made this a subclass of
   itkParameterizedImageSource so that it will work with the
   itkImageToParameterizedImageSourceMetric. Made all the getters be const
   methods (callable from const instances, that is). Implemented methods
   SetParameters(), GetParameters, and GetNumberOfParameters() all required by
   the abstract superclass.
   
   * itkImageToParameterizedImageSourceMetric.h,.cxx: New class that enables
   application of ImageToImageMetrics to a fixed, unchanging reference image
   (e.g., measured PSF image) to a moving, changing image produced by a
   ParameterizedImageSource (e.g. GibsonLanniPSFImageSource). This enables
   optimization of the PSF generator parameters via ITK's optimization framework.
   
   * itkParameterizedImageSource.h,.cxx: Subclass of ImageSource that specifies
   abstract methods SetParameters(), GetParameters, and GetNumberOfParameters().
   These parameters are not restricted to spatial transform parameters, as seems
   to be the case in most of ITK's registration framework.

2009-07-17  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

  * ChangeLog.txt: Added itkParameterizedImageSource.cxx and
  itkImageToParameterizedImageSourceMetric.cxx to list of sources.

2009-07-09  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * itk/itkGibsonLanniPSFImageSource.h,.cxx: Removed MechanicalTubeLength
   member variable which is actually specified in the 
   ActualDistanceFromBackFocalPlaneToDetector member variable. Fixed unit
   scaling problem with immersion oil thickness.

2009-07-08  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * itk/itkGibsonLanniPSFImageSource.h: Changed name of two parameters to more
   accurately reflect what they are, as well as their getters/setters. Added
   all member variables to the PrintSelf method. Added proper unit conversion.

2009-07-05  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * Initial check-in.
