   * itk/itkGibsonLanniBSFImageSource.cxx: Changed sampling frequency of PSF
   pre-integrated table.

   * itk/itkSphereConvolutionFilter.cxx: Fixed problem with indices in the
   pre-integrated PSF table. One of the z-coordinates was off by one voxel size.
   This is a little subtle, but becomes clear when looking at how to use prefix
   sums to obtain sums of arbitrary spans of consecutive elements in an array.

2009-09-14  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * itk/itkGibsonLanniBSFImageSource.cxx: Simplified code and added
   correct computation of the supersampled PSF lookup table origin.
   
   * itk/itkSphereConvolutionFilter.cxx: Fixed problem with top plane
   being too bright (caused by one of the lookup table points falling
   outside of the table).
   
2009-09-14  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * itk/itkSphereConvolutionFilter.cxx: Fixed problem with bottom-most
   plane being too bright (caused by one of the lookup table points falling
   outside of the table).

2009-09-14  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * itk/itkGibsonLanniPSFImageSource.h,.cxx: Switched to include <complex>
   instead of <complex.h> because Visual Studio C++ is not ISO 99 compliant.
   <complex> works just as well.

2009-09-09  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * itk/itkGibsonLanniBSFImageSource.h: Added calls to this->Modified() in
   methods that set parameters to ensure the filter is updated when Update()
   is called.

2009-09-09  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * itk/itkSphereConvolutionFilter.cxx: Fixed table lookup so that the 
   bead-spread function is not flipped in z.

2009-09-09  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * itk/itkGibsonLanniBSFImageSource.cxx: Bumped up the resolution at which the
   PSF is sampled.

2009-09-09  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * itk/itkGibsonLanniBSFImageSource.h: Re-wrote methods SetBeadCenter
   and SetBeadRadius so that they pass the values on to the
   itkSphereConvolutionFilter which does all the work.
   
   * itk/itkGibsonLanniBSFImageSource.cxx: Removed call to SetNthOutput in the
   constructor that was causing no end of problems. It is not the right way to
   make the output of an internal filter be the output of the containing filter
   (use GraftOutput() to do that). Pulled out all the debugging stuff that was
   in there.
   
   * itk/itkSphereConvolutionFilter.h: Added linear interpolator classes for
   both the pre-integrated PSF table and the PSF itself. These are used when
   computing each sample's contribution to each pixel in the bead-spread
   function.
   
   * itk/itkSphereConvolutionFilter.cxx: Fixed the sphere intersection test so
   that when there is only one intersection of the line with the sphere, both
   z values are set (only z1 was getting set before). Added in the interpolators
   mentioned above. Added sampling of the sphere in ThreadedGenerateData() to
   collect contributions from all over the sphere to each voxel. Fixed some of
   the lookup table math and also added safeguards against accessing out-of-
   bounds memory. 

2009-09-08  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Added itkGibsonLanniBSFImageSource.cxx and
   itkSphereConvolutionFilter.cxx to source file list.
   
   * itkGibsonLanniBSFImageSource.h,.cxx: New class that computes the bead-
   spread function of a wide-field fluorescence microscope. Intermediate
   check-in (not fully functional yet).
   
   * itkGibsonLanniPSFImageSource.h: Replaced 'template' keyword with 'class'
   in class template to fix compilation problem on gcc.
   
   * itkScanImageFilter.cxx: Added order parameter (increasing or decreasing
   along a dimension).
   
   * itkSphereConvolutionFilter.h,.cxx: New class that computes the convolution
   of a uniform density sphere function with an arbitrary input kernel. Intended
   to be used by itkGibsonLanniBSFImageSource to do the heavy lifting.

2009-07-26  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Added itkScanImageFilter to source list.

   * itk/itkGibsonLanniPSFImageSource.h,.cxx: Renamed ComputePixelValue() to
   ComputeSampleValue() (that's what it does) and added method
   ComputeIntegratedPixelValue() that performs the integration over a CCD
   element.

   * itk/itkScanImageFilter.h,.cxx: New class that performs a scan of all rows
   along a specified direction. The scan operator is a template parameter to 
   this class, so you can compute prefix sums, prefix min/max, etc. by 
   specifying a different operator (such operators are already defined in ITK).
   I'm going to use this for computing prefix sums of a super-sampled PSF image
   for use in efficient convolution of the PSF with volume-labeled geometry.

2009-07-23  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * itk/itkGibsonLanniPSFImageSource.h,.cxx: Added CCD border member variables
   as well as its setters and getters.

2009-07-21  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * itk/itkGibsonLanniPSFImageSource.cxx: Moved translation of PSF center point
   to immediately after voxel coordinate collection. z translation was not
   getting set.

2009-07-20  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * itk/itkGibsonLanniPSFImageSource.h,.cxx: Added point source center and
   accessors for it, as well as modified the PSF computation to take this into
   account. The parameter list now includes this instead of the image origin.
   
   * itk/itkImageToParameterizedImageSourceMetric.cxx: Added request of full
   image region to the moving image source. I'm still in shock that downstream
   filters in the pipeline can modify this in a way that sticks for filters
   branching off down another pipeline.

2009-07-20  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * itk/itkGibsonLanniPSFImageSource.h: Added some helpful comments.
   
   * itk/itkImageToParameterizedImageSourceMetric.cxx: Now GetValue() method
   sets only the active parameters (was setting all parameters, which was
   a major programming error). Method SetFixedImageRegion passes on region to
   the delegate ImageToImageMetric and removed the m_FixedImageRegion member
   variable.

2009-07-20  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * itk/itkImageToParameterizedImageSourceMetric.h,.cxx: Added parameter mask to
   enable optimization of only certain parameters in the ParameterizedImageSource.

2009-07-17  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * itkGibsonLanniPSFImageSource.h,.cxx: Made this a subclass of
   itkParameterizedImageSource so that it will work with the
   itkImageToParameterizedImageSourceMetric. Made all the getters be const
   methods (callable from const instances, that is). Implemented methods
   SetParameters(), GetParameters, and GetNumberOfParameters() all required by
   the abstract superclass.
   
   * itkImageToParameterizedImageSourceMetric.h,.cxx: New class that enables
   application of ImageToImageMetrics to a fixed, unchanging reference image
   (e.g., measured PSF image) to a moving, changing image produced by a
   ParameterizedImageSource (e.g. GibsonLanniPSFImageSource). This enables
   optimization of the PSF generator parameters via ITK's optimization framework.
   
   * itkParameterizedImageSource.h,.cxx: Subclass of ImageSource that specifies
   abstract methods SetParameters(), GetParameters, and GetNumberOfParameters().
   These parameters are not restricted to spatial transform parameters, as seems
   to be the case in most of ITK's registration framework.

2009-07-17  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

  * ChangeLog.txt: Added itkParameterizedImageSource.cxx and
  itkImageToParameterizedImageSourceMetric.cxx to list of sources.

2009-07-09  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * itk/itkGibsonLanniPSFImageSource.h,.cxx: Removed MechanicalTubeLength
   member variable which is actually specified in the 
   ActualDistanceFromBackFocalPlaneToDetector member variable. Fixed unit
   scaling problem with immersion oil thickness.

2009-07-08  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * itk/itkGibsonLanniPSFImageSource.h: Changed name of two parameters to more
   accurately reflect what they are, as well as their getters/setters. Added
   all member variables to the PrintSelf method. Added proper unit conversion.

2009-07-05  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * Initial check-in.
