   * DataModel.h: Added method UpdateGibsonLanniBSFImage().

2009-09-30  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * DataModel.cxx: Added call to turn on mean subtraction in the normalized
   correlation image-to-image metric (it's not subtracted by default; how can
   it be normalized without mean subtraction? This makes fitting to real data
   work much, much better.

2009-09-16  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * DataModel.h: Removed itkScanImageFilter that was used for testing.
   
   * DataModel.cxx: Removed unnecessary filter updates right after loading an
   image that made image loading take a lot longer than necessary. Also, hooked
   up optimization routine to the bead-spread function generator instead of the
   point-spread function generator.

2009-09-14  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * DataModel.h,.cxx: Added method SaveBSFImageFile() and fixed image
   rescaling during save to unsigned short TIFs.

2009-09-09  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * DataModel.h: Added calls to set parameter values in the bead-spread
   function source class.

2009-09-09  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * DataModel.cxx: Added writing of BeadCenter and BeadRadius parameters to
   session file.

2009-09-08  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Added ITKNumerics library to get access to AmoebaOptimizer.
   It worked before on MacOS X without including this library, but not on
   linux. I'm not sure why.

   * DataModel.h,.cxx: Added bead-spread function class and methods to pass
   parameters to it. 

2009-07-23  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * DataModel.h,.cxx: Added methods that read/write settings from a
   Configuration object. Added setter/getter for CCD border width.

2009-07-22  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * DataModel.h,.cxx: Added method GetMeasuredImageDataMaximumCoordinates().

2009-07-21  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * DataModel.h,.cxx: Added methods to set parameters in the Gibson-Lanni
   source by index.

2009-07-20  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * DataModel.h,.cxx: Added method to set center of PSF. I was using the image
   origin to calculate the pixel coordinates, but this proved cumbersome and
   error prone. Prior to optimization, added update of the requested region
   of the fixed image in the delegate ImageToImageCostFunction to be the entire
   image.

2009-07-20  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * DataModel.cxx: Bumped convergence tolerance down to 1e-3. Should expose
   this in the GUI.

2009-07-20  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * DataModel.h,.cxx: Added AmoebaOptimizer from ITK (Nelder-Mead simplex).
   Hard-coded parameter mask for image origin optimization.

2009-07-17  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * DataModel.h,.cxx: Added references to new class
   ImageToParameterizedImageSourceMetric. Added methods to set the origin on the
   measured image (typical use case: match the measured image origin to that of
   the calculated image origin). Added NormalizedCorrelationImageToImageMetric
   as the delegate metric for the ImageToParameterizedImageSourceMetric.

2009-07-14  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * DataModel.h,.cxx: Added methods/variables for generated PSF image, renamed
   methods/variables rlated to measured PSF image. PSF is not generated until
   after measured PSF is loaded. Fixed bug in min/max calculation of image by
   explicitly setting the requested region for the filter to the largest possible
   size. Added method for setting generated PSF origin. 

2009-07-09  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * DataModel.h,.cxx: Removed setter/getter for mechanical tube length variable.
   Added methods to set PSF image dimensions.

2009-07-08  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * DataModel.h,.cxx: Updated to reflect method name changes in
   itkGibsonLanniPSFImageSource.

2009-07-05  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * Initial check-in.
