   * DataModel.h,.cxx: Added methods to set parameters in the Gibson-Lanni
   source by index.

   * DataModel.h,.cxx: Added method to set center of PSF. I was using the image
   origin to calculate the pixel coordinates, but this proved cumbersome and
   error prone. Prior to optimization, added update of the requested region
   of the fixed image in the delegate ImageToImageCostFunction to be the entire
   image.

   * DataModel.cxx: Bumped convergence tolerance down to 1e-3. Should expose
   this in the GUI.

2009-07-20  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * DataModel.h,.cxx: Added AmoebaOptimizer from ITK (Nelder-Mead simplex).
   Hard-coded parameter mask for image origin optimization.

2009-07-17  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * DataModel.h,.cxx: Added references to new class
   ImageToParameterizedImageSourceMetric. Added methods to set the origin on the
   measured image (typical use case: match the measured image origin to that of
   the calculated image origin). Added NormalizedCorrelationImageToImageMetric
   as the delegate metric for the ImageToParameterizedImageSourceMetric.

   * DataModel.h,.cxx: Added methods/variables for generated PSF image, renamed
   methods/variables rlated to measured PSF image. PSF is not generated until
   after measured PSF is loaded. Fixed bug in min/max calculation of image by
   explicitly setting the requested region for the filter to the largest possible
   size. Added method for setting generated PSF origin. 

2009-07-09  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * DataModel.h,.cxx: Removed setter/getter for mechanical tube length variable.
   Added methods to set PSF image dimensions.

2009-07-08  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * DataModel.h,.cxx: Updated to reflect method name changes in
   itkGibsonLanniPSFImageSource.

2009-07-05  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * Initial check-in.
