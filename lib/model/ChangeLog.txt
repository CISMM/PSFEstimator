   * DataModel.h,.cxx: Added references to new class
   ImageToParameterizedImageSourceMetric. Added methods to set the origin on the
   measured image (typical use case: match the measured image origin to that of
   the calculated image origin). Added NormalizedCorrelationImageToImageMetric
   as the delegate metric for the ImageToParameterizedImageSourceMetric.

   * DataModel.h,.cxx: Added methods/variables for generated PSF image, renamed
   methods/variables rlated to measured PSF image. PSF is not generated until
   after measured PSF is loaded. Fixed bug in min/max calculation of image by
   explicitly setting the requested region for the filter to the largest possible
   size. Added method for setting generated PSF origin.

   * DataModel.h,.cxx: Removed setter/getter for mechanical tube length variable.
   Added methods to set PSF image dimensions.

   * DataModel.h,.cxx: Updated to reflect method name changes in
   itkGibsonLanniPSFImageSource.
