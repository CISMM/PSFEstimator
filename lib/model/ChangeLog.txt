   * DataModel.h,.cxx: Added methods/variables for generated PSF image, renamed
   methods/variables rlated to measured PSF image. PSF is not generated until
   after measured PSF is loaded. Fixed bug in min/max calculation of image by
   explicitly setting the requested region for the filter to the largest possible
   size. Added method for setting generated PSF origin.
